# Hi, Iâ€™m Ruth ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a product leader with over 10 years experience in product management, having held roles such as Group/Lead PM and Head of Product at a thriving scale-up. I offer interim product management services, and mentor both founders and team members in honing their product management skills. I streamline processes to prioritise effectively, deeply understand customer needs, and deliver impactful results.

I specialise in strategy, discovery, and delivery, with a proven track record of launching products from 0 to 1, managing cross-functional initiatives, and ensuring seamless execution. Communication and collaboration are at the heart of my work, allowing me to build trust-based relationships that create environments where teams can thrive and achieve measurable success.

My services are ideal for organisations looking for short-term leadership or expert support to accelerate their product goals and make meaningful progress.
